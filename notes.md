1. Hostname could not be resolved.
2. Can't use IP or domain as sys.argv. (Have to change "target" to "name" ?)
3. Should save the banner and all extra port info to the text file aswell.
4. Easily readable format from banner


How do you get your banners to always respond? My port 22 sometimes times out. And I can never get port 80.
